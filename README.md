# suse-migration-container
A container with opensuse 42.2 to test a set of migration tools.

Will set up suse container with sshd in supervisor. 
This is used for test upgrade for mule and jdk. Note that you need to get the jdks and mule ee jars as well as the 
license file yourself as these cannot be placed on a open repo. 

# Migrate
The migrate variables are placed in to the host file. So it can be changed for the target environments you want to aim for.
